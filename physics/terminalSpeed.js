   * or water). It is caused by the friction and turbulence between the object and the fluid. In this
   * context, the drag parameter is likely referring to the drag coefficient, which is a dimensionless
   * quantity that represents the
   * @param gravity - The force of gravity acting on the object, usually measured in meters per second
   * squared (m/s^2).
   * @param airDensity - Air density is the mass of air per unit volume. It is typically measured in
   * kilograms per cubic meter (kg/mÂ³) and is an important parameter in aerodynamics and fluid
